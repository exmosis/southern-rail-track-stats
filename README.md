# southern-rail-track-stats

Southern Rail provide daily perfomance stats at http://www.southernrailway.com/your-journey/performance-results/daily/, but sadly no archive of previous performance. This script is a quick attempt to archive perfomance stats in the interest of public transparency, and publish them in a more usable format.

Please do let me know if this data is available elsewhere already...
